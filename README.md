### Introduction
This is a project I created in Python using the os module and defining my own functions. The project keeps a track on tasks and users, allowing users to login and create new tasks. Users can also mark a task as complete, edit the information on a task (if it isn't complete), add new users and generate reports.

### Setup
To run the program, copy the task_manager.py file to a code editor and run the program. This will run a clean program with no information stored. Alternatively, you can copy task_overview.txt, tasks.txt, user_overview.txt and user.txt for readily available information for the program to use. Copying all of the .txt files will allow you to use all of the features in the program without needing to fill in your own information.

### Running
Once the program is running, you will be presented with a login section. By default, username 'admin' and password 'password' exists. If you copied user.txt file, you can view that for other username and password combinations. After logging in, you will be presented with a menu of commands you can perform. Enter the letter(s) for the command you would like and follow the information shown to proceed.

### Screenshots

When 'vm' is entered at the main menu, the console will show all tasks assigned to the current user that is logged in. You are able to edit the task by entering the task number or return to main menu. As shown, if the task is already marked as complete, you can not edit it. After selecting an available task, you are presented with the option to 'Mark as complete' or 'Edit'. If 'Edit' is chosen, you are presented with another option of what you would like to edit.
